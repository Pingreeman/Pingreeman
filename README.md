- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pingreeman
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Python in retirement to build a side hussle business not coding or developing, but by building some projects for crawling, scraping, and building content for my future blog site. I will ultimately be retiriing to Colombia, SA.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and need ALL THE HELP I CAN GET! ROLA
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project to help scrape and store metadata to my home NAS; I would also like to giv back to the community where I retire to teach EASL and maybe start a tech traing for Python wannabes.
- 📫 How to reach me email is ideal - - - I am not sure Ishouldpost it here, though?
- 😄 Pronouns: nothing woke for me - male so use he
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have been implementing ERP systems for nearly 40 years, worked with many developers to build enhancements but never coded a single line in any language.
